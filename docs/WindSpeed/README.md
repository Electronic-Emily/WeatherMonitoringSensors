# Wind Speed Sensor
## Functionality 
Do the the complexity of developing both a wind direction and a wind speed sensor, I opted to buy the wind speed sensor for this version of the Weather station. 
Based on the supplier's website, the recommened voltage is 9V0 volts. So for this reason I set the potentiometer on the power supply to 9V0 and placed some locktite on the screw to prevent movement. 
For this project the speed sensor's input will be, 9V0 and return.
While the output will be an analog volatage. Further testing will determine what resistor divider ratio that will be needed.
